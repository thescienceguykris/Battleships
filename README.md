# Battleships
This repo has the code for building your own machine learning (ML) model to help you destroy your friends at Battleship.

Battleships originated in World War I as a pencil and paper game; each player's fleet are marked on a board, concealed from the opposing player. Players take it in turns to shoot at their opponent with the aim to destroy their fleet before they destroy yours.

I'm notoriously bad at Battleship and whilst there are statistical approaches on how to win (Vsauce has a video explaining 'The Battleship Algorithm' on his YouTube channel), I've never been a fan of calculating probabilities. In this repo, and accompanying blog, we're going to develop a ML model that can play battleship!
